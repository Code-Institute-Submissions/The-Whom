### Technologies used in the project

* [Cloud 9](https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/) IDE was used to write the **HTML** and **CSS** 
* [Bootstrap framework (v 3.3.7)](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/getting-started/) was used to **structure** the page and add components (ex: forms, button, navigation items, e.t.c)
* [Fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons were used for **social media links** and **navigation icons**
* [Google fonts](https://fonts.google.com) were used on all **text** (i.e: [Knewave](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Knewave), [Anton](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Anton) and [crete round](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Crete+Round)
 

### Deployment and testing

##### Deployment 

The project was uploaded to the github pages (via [git](https://git-scm.com)).
Github was updated with each addition of major content, i.e: with the creation of:
-  the header
-  the footer
-  each page addition (music page, video page, e.t.c)
-  after each testing and improvement 

To run the code, simply open using any web browser.

##### Testing

In addition to testing after each new component was added, other more through testing was
conducted at the end of the competition of each major stage (i.e: creation of header, footer, and the section areas for each page)

Testing consisted of: checking the validity of the code (using W3C [HTML](https://validator.w3.org) and [CSS](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) validator) and the behavior of each element across all screen sizes.

After, googleâ€™s developer tools were used to audit the site, using both mobile and desktop audits.

Final checks were conducted by several independent people at the end of the project, to ensure all was working as expected and the user experience was uniform.

Layout is similar across all screen sizes, with the following differences between mobile and desktop resolutions detailed below:

- Footer links disappear on mobile screens
- Music page: albums appear vertically aligned on mobile, rather than horizontal on desktop
- within each album page (ex: generations), the album list and where to buy are displayed to the right on desktop, whilst being below on mobile 
- Photo page: pictures appear with captions to the right on desktop, whilst appearing below on mobile
