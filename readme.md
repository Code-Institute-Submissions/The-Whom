### Deployment and testing

##### Deployment 

The project was deployed in several stages:

1. Initial planning stage, concentrating on the guidelines provided, which were
 *to create a website that could showcase the media of the band, allow fans to hire them
and even to contact the band via their social media*

2. Refinement of the requirements and the creation of wireframes, to provide a basis for the 
layout and look of the pages

3. Creation/collection of all text, images, videos and photos used for the website 

4. Writing the code begins with them creation of the repeated elements, i.e: the footer and the header

5. Then each page was created in turn, re-using the same header and footer, adding in the specific content for each page
 (Pages were created in the follwing order: index, music, generations (album page), vidoes, photos and finally contact.)

6. Final thorough testing of the pages was then conducted accross all screen sizes

7. Finally, the readme.md page was written and added.

##### Testing

In addition to testing after each new component was added, other more through testing was
conducted at the end of the competition of each major stage (i.e: creation of header, footer, and the section areas for each page)

Testing consisted of: checking the validity of the code and the behaviour of each element across all screen sizes.

Final checks were conducted at the end of the project, to ensure all was working as expected.
